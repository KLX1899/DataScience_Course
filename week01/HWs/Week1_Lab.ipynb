        "1.   There are companies that own trains, planes, buses and other means of transportation. There are also people who want to travel between two destinations in two different cities within a certain time frame. MR.Bilit is a bridge between companies and people that provides services. It sells tickets for companies and also transports people.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.   TOTAL TICKET SOLD: core measure of demand and business volume<br>REVENUE: tells you the actual monetary performance, not just volume<br>BOOKING CONVERSATION RATE: shows how efficiently your traffic turns into paying customers<br>these three togehter tell you \"how much interest you're attracting\", \"how well you're closing sales\" and \"how much money you're making from it\".\n",
        "\n",
        "3.   Yes; cancellation rate is critical because each cancelled ticket can mean lost revenue, wasted seat inventory, extra operational costs for processing refunds, and potential damage to customer trust. High cancellations make demand forecasting less reliable and can block opportunities to resell seats in time, hurting both profitability and service quality. That’s why ticketing businesses track it closely and use policies or pricing strategies to keep it under control.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.   investors / customers / suppliers (airlines, train companies, ...) / internal teams / payment & financial partners / companies that have advertised on MR.Bilit\n",
        "\n",
        "5.   suppliers / investors\n",
        "\n",
        "6.   in general, the peak of travel is consistently in the summer (schools and universities are closed, some companies are closed for the summer) and nowruz. depending on the holidays and their location in the week, there may be periods of growth, but usually not as much as nowruz and summer.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.   seasonal demand in MR.Bilit’s business means peak periods like nowruz, summer holidays, and winter trips bring sharp increases in sales, revenue, and operational workload, while off‑season months can see lower bookings and cash flow. high‑demand seasons require careful seat allocation, dynamic pricing, and strong supplier coordination, whereas low‑demand periods call for more promotions to stimulate sales. seasonality also affects cancellation patterns, staffing needs, and marketing focus throughout the year.<br> **MY QUESTION:** Instead of trying to attract customers during low demand seasons, wouldn't it be better to try harder during high demand seasons to gain more market share during peak pricing and customer demand?\n",
        "\n",
        "8.   MR.Bilit can increase profitability by combining revenue growth strategies like dynamic pricing, upselling add‑ons (insurance, seat selection), expanding profitable routes, and targeting high‑value customer segments—with cost efficiency measures, such as automating booking and refund processes, optimizing marketing spend toward high‑ROI channels, and improving supplier negotiations for better commissions. Reducing cancellation rates and filling off‑peak gaps with promotions or partnerships can also stabilize cash flow and boost margins year‑round.\n",

        "9.   change in travel plan or scedule / illness or personal emergencies / better pricing found elsewhere / visa issues / weather disruptions / safety concerns / purpose of travel canceled / booking errors\n",
        "\n",
        "10.   **QUESTION:** how can we generate more revenue simply by better scheduling passengers on a vehicle?<br>**ANSWER:** Student trips between semesters are usually short, and a quick and timely return is very important to them. Business trips, on the other hand, are usually more important to a quick and timely return. For both groups, price is one of the most influential factors in choosing a ticket. Depending on the number of passengers, a specific vehicle can be offered at a discount for students (for example, from Tehran to Isfahan) and employees returning to Tehran, and after a few days, when a significant number of them want to return, it can be provided for students and employees returning. In this way, we have somewhat predetermined the passengers of a vehicle before selling return tickets."
